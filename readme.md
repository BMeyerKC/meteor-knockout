# Knockout for Meteor

Data bindings with form validation for Meteor

## How to install 
1. npm install meteorite (if not already installed)
2. mrt add knockout

## Description
This package provides the full power of Knockout to Meteor.

That being said - the focus is two killer features:
1. Form Auto-Syncing
2. Form Validation

Currently Meteor has no form validation and to write synced forms requires tons of boiler-plate.

## Demos
I am working on a full demo - to be released soon

The demos (examples) in [Knockout.Meteor](https://github.com/steveluscher/knockout.meteor) work - remove the client dir and run "mrt add knockout".
